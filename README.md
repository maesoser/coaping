# coaping
=======

A ping for CoAP, the constrained Application Protocol **written in C**

### First things first
First of all, I want to say that there is a code with the same name written for ruby by [**cabo**](https://github.com/cabo) that does more or less the same as my code. But he did it before me. You can find it [**here**](https://github.com/cabo/coaping)

### Examples

- Send three CoAP empty `CON` datagrams to vs0.inf.ethz.ch, port 12345:
```
coaping -n 3 -p 12345 vs0.inf.ethz.ch
```
- Send infinite CoAP empty `CON` datagrams to vs0.inf.ethz.ch, port 57278:
```
coaping vs0.inf.ethz.ch
coaping -n 0 vs0.inf.ethz.ch
```

The expected output for the last example should look like this:

```
